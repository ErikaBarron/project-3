This project is an interactive program that prints a menu of actions such as create, open, insert, search, load, print, export, and quit. Then it prompts the user to type an action. It is  case-insensitive, and only a index file that has been previously created in the program with the valid magic number is able to be opened. It implements a BTree Index Manager in Java, providing functionalities to create, manage, and interact with B-Tree based index files. Tree has a minimal degree of 10 with the maximum number of key-value pairs per node is 19. The index file is divided into blocks of 512 bytes with a header file using the entire first block. If the file the user is trying to create already exists, the program prompts the user with "File already exists. Overwrite? (yes/no):" 
Only contains one file called BTreeIndexManager.java since the programs purpose is to create and manage index files.
