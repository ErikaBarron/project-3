This project is an interactive program that prints a menu of actions such as create, open, insert, search, load, print, export, and quit. Then it prompts the user to type an action. It is  case-insensitive, and only a index file that has been previously created in the program with the valid magic number is able to be opened. It implements a BTree Index Manager in Java, providing functionalities to create, manage, and interact with B-Tree based index files. Tree has a minimal degree of 10 with the maximum number of key-value pairs per node is 19. The index file is divided into blocks of 512 bytes with a header file using the entire first block. If the file the user is trying to create already exists, the program prompts the user with "File already exists. Overwrite? (yes/no):" 
Only contains one file called BTreeIndexManager.java since the programs purpose is to create and manage index files.
How to compile and run on terminal: type the javac command to compile the source file. After compilation, execute the program using the java command
IMPORTANT: I did not correctly save all of my commits to my devlog.md file so it only has my first ever commit. To see the rest of my commits you need to open the master branch default to access all of the commits I made in this project.
